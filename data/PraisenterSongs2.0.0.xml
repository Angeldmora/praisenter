   So I lift my eyes to you Lord; In your strength will I break through Lord, touch me now, let your love fall down on me, I know your love dispells all my fears; Through the storm I will hold on Lord,
   And by faith I will walk on Lord, then Iâ€™ll see beyond my Calvary one day, And I will be     complete in you.</Text>

Where I have been

 On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air</Text>

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change

            <Text>Only one life
So soon it will pass
Only what's done
For Christ will last
Only one chance to do His will
So give to Jesus all your days
It's the only life that pays
When you recall
You have but one life</Text>

I was searching for love
I just needed some affection
All I got just left me wanting more
Left me feeling cold and lonely
On the inside
With nothing to show
But I had plenty to hide</Text>

Looking back on all the
